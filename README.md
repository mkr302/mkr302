# Welcome to my Tech Odyssey!

## In the Trenches:

Engineering and Data Science enthusiast with over 14 years of hands-on experience in Technology, Product Development, and Banking. I’ve had the privilege (and sometimes the chaos) of leading diverse, cross-functional teams across different time zones for the past 5 years. You could say I’ve gotten pretty good at knowing what time it is everywhere. I’m a strong believer in the power of data-driven decision-making - numbers don’t lie, though they can be pretty good at playing hide and seek. With a solid background in software engineering and data science, I’ve helped launch over 300 products in Telecom, Insurance, Banking, and Retail. These adventures have led to nearly $400 million in cost savings and the achievement of more than 200 strategic goals. When I’m not busy finding creative solutions, I’m probably daydreaming about what the next big challenge will be, because who doesn’t love a good puzzle?
